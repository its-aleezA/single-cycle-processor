## üìñ Project Overview

This Verilog-based CPU project implements a complete single-cycle RISC-V processor with:

- Full instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory, and writeback stages
- Support for basic arithmetic, logical, and memory operations
- Register file with 32 registers
- Sign extension unit for immediate values
- Modular design with clean separation of components

- Supports:
  - Arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB)
  - Logical operations (AND, OR, XOR)
  - Memory operations (LW, SW)
  - Control flow (BEQ)
- Modular Verilog implementation
- Data memory and instruction memory modules
- Hazard-free design (single cycle)
